# **Meeting: Code Review & Protocol**

**Date: 03/12/2025**

**Attendees: Both developers present**

## Meeting Notes

- Thoroughly reviewed and discussed our changes (bus factor)
    - Reviewed the current Server Listener implementation
        - Discussed how storing connections in a HashMap prevents concurrency as it holds the connection in the main thread
        - Proposed spawn tasks (tokio)
    - Reviewed file hashing & CLI
        - Dissected the buffer logic and its potential use for the server when downloading and sending files
        - Discussed how SHA256 is a one-way unique hash that guarantees authenticity and why it should be stored alongside corresponding files on the server 
        - Showed CLI implementation and discussed potential CLI commands 
            - Discussed how one-shot CLI keeps the server passive and stateless

- Wire Format & Header solution
    - Discussed header length (can't be inside json), must be sent as a raw 4-byte int (u32)

&nbsp;

Decisions made:

- Protocol - \[Length u32\] \[JSON Header\] \[Data\]
- Server Logic - HashMap will be replaced with independent background tasks (spawn)
